# GridMinCut
Minimum s-t cut through cells in a grid

Solution to the Daily Programmer Idea https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer_ideas/comments/qq4ssg/find_the_minimum_number_of_walls_to_add_such_that/ which implements the Edmunds Karp algorithm adapted to vertices, as described in this document: http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~wendym/courses/422/17/notes/422_19_vertex_connectivity.pdf.

The grid data is read on standard input. Sample files are available to test the program and show how the input format works.
